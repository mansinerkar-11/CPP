/*
---adjacency matrix---
There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then there is an 
edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight take to reach city B from A,
 or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a graph. The node can be represented by
  airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency list representation of the graph or use adjacency
   matrix representation of the graph.Check whether the graph is connected or not. Justify the storage 
   representation used.
